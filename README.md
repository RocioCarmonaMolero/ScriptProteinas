# Scripts for the project: Identification and Characterization of the Aldehyde Dehydrogenase Gene Superfamily (ALDH) in *Cicer arietinum*

This work has been based on the systematic search of sequences in the [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). For this we have run numerous scripts written in the R programming language in order to reduce manual steps as much as possible and thus be able to extract, filter and catalog the results of that search efficiently. Every final function is uploaded and available in this repository.

You can read the steps followed on the work in the [TFM](https://github.com/RocioCarmonaMolero/TFMweb/blob/master/TFM.md) repository.
