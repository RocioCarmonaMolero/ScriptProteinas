#Scripts for the project: Identification and Characterization of the Aldehyde Dehydrogenase Gene Superfamily (ALDH) in *Cicer arietinum*

This work has been based on the systematic search of sequences in the N. For this we have applied a series of scripts written in the programming language R in order to reduce manual steps as much as possible and thus be able to extract, filter and catalog the results of that search in an efficient way. We have also worked with a version control system of the scripts (git) that allows reconstructing the history of the project. All versions are hosted and publicly available in an internet repository (gitHub) (https://github.com/RocioCarmonaMolero/ScriptProteinas).
